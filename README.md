# week_pick_button

## Installing:
In your pubspec.yaml
```yaml
dependencies:
  week_picker_button: ^0.0.2
```
Attention! In Flutter 3.7 the Badge widget was introduced in the Material library, so to escape the ambiguous imports you need to import the package like this:
```dart
import 'package:week_pick_button/week_picker_button.dart';
```
and then use the "badges.Badge" widget instead of the "Badge" widget. The same for all the classes from this package.
